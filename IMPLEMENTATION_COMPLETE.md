## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Ensure Server is Running

Your server should already be running on http://localhost:8000

If not:
```bash
python run_fixed.py
```

### Step 2: Open Web UI

Navigate to: **http://localhost:8000**

### Step 3: Upload Data

**Option A: Drag & Drop**
1. Drag `examples/sales_data.csv` onto the upload zone
2. Wait for processing (should take < 2 seconds)
3. Database will auto-select

**Option B: Browse**
1. Click "Browse Files" button
2. Select a CSV or Excel file
3. Click Open

### Step 4: Query Your Data

Once database is selected, try these queries:

```
"Show me all the data"
"What's the total revenue?"
"Which product sold the most?"
"Calculate average price per product"
"List sales sorted by date"
```

The AI will automatically use SQL via MCP tools to answer!

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Basic Upload Test
- [ ] Upload `examples/sales_data.csv`
- [ ] Verify success message shows "10 rows"
- [ ] Check database appears in dropdown
- [ ] Confirm database info shows: 1 table, 10 rows, 5 columns

### Query Test
- [ ] Ask: "Show me all the data"
- [ ] Verify AI uses `execute_query` tool
- [ ] Check response shows all 10 rows
- [ ] Ask: "What's the total revenue?"
- [ ] Verify AI calculates sum correctly

### Multiple Database Test
- [ ] Upload another CSV file
- [ ] Check both databases appear in dropdown
- [ ] Switch between databases using dropdown
- [ ] Verify queries work on each database

### Excel Test (if you have an Excel file)
- [ ] Upload .xlsx file with multiple sheets
- [ ] Verify all sheets become separate tables
- [ ] Query data from different sheets

---

## 📈 What Can You Do Now?

### 1. **Analyze Your Own Data**
Upload any CSV or Excel file and ask questions:
- Sales data → "What were our top products last quarter?"
- Financial data → "Show me expenses by category"
- Customer data → "How many customers signed up last month?"

### 2. **Compare Multiple Datasets**
Upload different files and switch between them:
- Compare sales across different periods
- Analyze data from different sources
- Track changes over time

### 3. **Complex Queries**
The AI can handle sophisticated SQL:
- Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
- Filtering (WHERE clauses)
- Sorting (ORDER BY)
- Grouping (GROUP BY)
- Joins (if multi-sheet Excel)

---

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Column Name Sanitization
Special characters are automatically converted:
- "Product Name" → "product_name"
- "Sales ($)" → "sales"
- "2024 Revenue" → "col_2024_revenue"

### Data Type Inference
Pandas automatically detects:
- Integers (ID, quantity)
- Floats (prices, percentages)
- Strings (names, descriptions)
- Dates (with proper formatting)

### Index Creation
Indexes are automatically created on columns named:
- "id", "index", "key" (case-insensitive)

### Multi-Sheet Excel
Each sheet becomes a table:
- Sheet "Sales" → table `sales`
- Sheet "Products" → table `products`
- Sheet "Customers" → table `customers`

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Upload Fails
**Error:** "Unsupported file type"
- **Fix:** Ensure file has .csv, .xlsx, or .xls extension

**Error:** "File too large"
- **Fix:** File must be under 100MB

**Error:** "CSV file is empty"
- **Fix:** Check CSV has data rows, not just headers

### Database Not Showing
- Click the refresh button (🔄)
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `uploads/metadata.json` exists

### Query Returns No Results
- Use dropdown to verify correct database is selected
- Ask: "list tables" to see available tables
- Ask: "describe table data" to see column names
- Remember columns are sanitized (lowercase, underscores)

### Connection Issues
- Ensure `run_fixed.py` is running
- Check no other service is using port 8000
- Restart server if needed

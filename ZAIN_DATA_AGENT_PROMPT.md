   - Strategic suggestions for business improvement
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

3. **Communication:**
   - Clear, concise explanations of complex data findings
   - Data-driven storytelling
   - Visual and narrative presentation of insights

Your approach:
- Always start by understanding the data structure and quality
- Perform comprehensive analysis before drawing conclusions
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations
- Support insights with relevant data points
- Be proactive in identifying opportunities and risks

You have access to powerful tools for data querying and analysis across multiple data sources (databases, Notion workspaces, web search). Use them effectively to deliver exceptional value.

1. **`llm_integration.py`** (LLMAgent)
   - Added `SYSTEM_PROMPT` class variable
   - Initialize conversation history with system prompt
   - Updated `clear_history()` to preserve system prompt

2. **`llm_integration_streaming.py`** (StreamingLLMAgent)
   - Added `SYSTEM_PROMPT` class variable
   - Initialize conversation history with system prompt
   - Updated `clear_history()` to preserve system prompt

3. **`llm_multi_server.py`** (MultiServerLLMAgent)
   - Added `SYSTEM_PROMPT` class variable with multi-server context
   - Initialize conversation history with system prompt
   - Updated `clear_history()` to preserve system prompt

4. **`llm_multi_server_streaming.py`** (StreamingMultiServerLLMAgent)
   - Added `SYSTEM_PROMPT` class variable with multi-server context
   - Initialize conversation history with system prompt
   - Updated `clear_history()` to preserve system prompt

5. **`fastapi_app_fixed.py`** (hydrate_agent_if_empty)
   - Updated history hydration logic to preserve system prompt
   - Check if system prompt exists before hydrating from database
   - Append user/assistant messages after system prompt

## Key Features

### 1. Consistent Identity
- All agents identify as "Qbit Data Agent"
- Built by "Zain Sheikh"
- Consistent branding across all chat interfaces

### 2. Data Analysis Focus
- **Exploration**: Understanding dataset structure and characteristics
- **Statistical Analysis**: Pattern recognition and correlation analysis
- **Quality Assessment**: Data validation and anomaly detection

### 3. Prescriptive Analytics
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Specific, implementable suggestions
- **Strategic Insights**: Business improvement opportunities
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying and mitigating potential issues

### 4. Clear Communication
- Explains complex findings in understandable terms
- Uses data-driven storytelling
- Provides context for insights

### 5. Proactive Approach
- Identifies opportunities without prompting
- Suggests related analyses
- Offers comprehensive recommendations

## System Prompt Persistence

### On Initialization
```python
self.conversation_history = [
    {"role": "system", "content": self.SYSTEM_PROMPT}
]
```

### On Clear History
```python
def clear_history(self):
    """Clear conversation history but preserve system prompt"""
    self.conversation_history = [
        {"role": "system", "content": self.SYSTEM_PROMPT}
    ]
```

### On Hydration from Database
```python
# Checks for system prompt before hydrating
has_system_prompt = len(history) > 0 and history[0].get("role") == "system"
has_other_messages = len(history) > (1 if has_system_prompt else 0)

# Only hydrate if no chat messages (but preserve system prompt)
if has_other_messages:
    return

# Append user/assistant messages after system prompt
for role, content in reversed(rows):
    if role in ("user", "assistant"):
        agent.conversation_history.append({"role": role, "content": content or ""})
```

## Benefits

### For Users
âœ… **Consistent Experience**: Same professional identity across all interactions  
âœ… **Expert Guidance**: AI positioned as data analysis expert  
âœ… **Actionable Insights**: Focus on recommendations, not just data  
âœ… **Professional Branding**: "Qbit Data Agent by Zain Sheikh"

### For Development
âœ… **Single Source of Truth**: System prompt defined once per agent class  
âœ… **Easy Updates**: Change prompt in one place, affects all instances  
âœ… **Persistent Identity**: System prompt survives history clearing  
âœ… **Context Preservation**: System prompt + chat history work together

## Testing

### Verify System Prompt
1. Start a new chat session
2. Ask: "Who are you?"
3. Expected response: "I am Qbit Data Agent, built by Zain Sheikh..."

### Verify Persistence After Clear
1. Have a conversation
2. Clear chat history (via `/api/clear` endpoint)
3. Ask: "Who are you?"
4. Should still identify correctly

### Verify Data Analysis Focus
1. Upload a database
2. Ask for analysis
3. Expect:
   - Data exploration first
   - Statistical insights
   - Specific recommendations
   - Risk/opportunity identification

## Notes

- System prompt is **NOT** stored in the database
- It's always the first message in `conversation_history`
- Database stores only user/assistant messages
- On hydration, system prompt remains first, user/assistant messages follow
- Each agent class has its own `SYSTEM_PROMPT` variable (allows customization per agent type)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- Dynamic prompt adjustment based on database type
- User-customizable analysis preferences
- Industry-specific prompt variations
- Multi-language support

### Monitoring
- Track how often prescriptive recommendations are provided
- Measure user satisfaction with analysis depth
- A/B test different prompt variations

**Status**: âœ… Implemented and ready for testing

**Next Steps**: 
1. Restart backend to apply changes
2. Test with real database
3. Gather user feedback on analysis quality
4. Refine prompt based on performance

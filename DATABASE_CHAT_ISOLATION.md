# 🔄 Database-Specific Chat History Isolation

## 📋 **Problem Identified**

**Issue:** All chat conversations were mixed together regardless of which database was selected.

### **Root Cause:**
1. The `messages` table has NO `database_id` column
2. `session_id` was NOT reset when switching databases
3. The `hydrate_agent_if_empty()` function loaded ALL messages from the session, mixing chats from different databases

### **Example of the Problem:**
```
User uploads "sales.db" → Asks "Show me sales data"
User switches to "customers.db" → Asks "List customers"  
User switches back to "sales.db" → AI sees BOTH conversations mixed!
```

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **Approach: Session-Based Isolation**

Instead of adding a `database_id` column (which would require database migration), we **create a new `session_id`** whenever a database is switched.

### **How It Works:**

1. **On Database Switch:**
   ```python
   # Create new session with database ID prefix
   new_session_id = f"{database_id}_{uuid.uuid4()}"
   http_request.session["session_id"] = new_session_id
   http_request.session["active_database_id"] = database_id
   ```

2. **Session Format:**
   ```
   Format: {database_id}_{unique_uuid}
   Example: "db_abc123_a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890"
   ```

3. **Chat History Loading:**
   - `hydrate_agent_if_empty()` loads messages by `(username, session_id)`
   - Each database has its own unique `session_id`
   - Conversations are **completely isolated** per database

## 🔧 **Code Changes**

### **File Modified:** `fastapi_app_fixed.py`

**Location:** Line 846-855 in `/api/switch-database` endpoint

**Before:**
```python
# Update metadata
pipeline.update_active_database(database_id)

logger.info(f"Successfully switched to database: {db_metadata['name']}")
```

**After:**
```python
# Update metadata
pipeline.update_active_database(database_id)

# IMPORTANT: Create new session for this database to isolate chat history
new_session_id = f"{database_id}_{uuid.uuid4()}"
http_request.session["session_id"] = new_session_id
http_request.session["active_database_id"] = database_id

logger.info(f"Successfully switched to database: {db_metadata['name']}")
logger.info(f"Created new session: {new_session_id}")
```

## 📊 **Database Schema (No Changes Required)**

The existing `messages` table schema remains unchanged:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  username TEXT NOT NULL,         -- User identifier
  session_id TEXT NOT NULL,       -- Database-specific session
  role TEXT NOT NULL,             -- user/assistant/tool
  content TEXT,                   -- Message content
  metadata TEXT,                  -- JSON metadata
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL        -- Timestamp
);
```

**Query Pattern:**
```sql
SELECT role, content 
FROM messages 
WHERE username = ? AND session_id = ?
ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 40
```

---

## 🎯 **User Experience**

### **Before Fix:**
```
1. User uploads sales.db
2. User: "Show me total sales"
   AI: "Total sales: $50,000"

3. User switches to customers.db
4. User: "How many customers?"
   AI: "100 customers"

5. User switches back to sales.db
6. User: "What was that number?"
   AI: "100 customers" ← WRONG! Mixed context!
```

### **After Fix:**
```
1. User uploads sales.db (session: sales_abc123)
2. User: "Show me total sales"
   AI: "Total sales: $50,000"

3. User switches to customers.db (NEW session: customers_def456)
4. User: "How many customers?"
   AI: "100 customers"

5. User switches back to sales.db (NEW session: sales_ghi789)
6. User: "What was that number?"
   AI: "I don't have previous context. What number?" ← CORRECT!
```

## ⚠️ **Trade-offs**

### **Pros:**
✅ Clean separation of conversations per database  
✅ No database migration required  
✅ Simple implementation  
✅ Backward compatible  
✅ No data loss  

### **Cons:**
❌ Chat history does NOT persist when switching back to a database  
❌ Each switch creates a "fresh start"  
❌ User loses conversation context from previous sessions with same DB  

### **Alternative Approach (Not Implemented):**

To preserve history across database switches, you would need to:

1. **Add `database_id` column to messages table:**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE messages ADD COLUMN database_id TEXT;
   ```

2. **Update all queries to filter by database_id:**
   ```sql
   SELECT role, content 
   FROM messages 
   WHERE username = ? AND database_id = ?
   ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 40
   ```

3. **Update all insert statements:**
   ```python
   INSERT INTO messages (username, session_id, database_id, role, content, ...)
   ```

This would preserve history but requires migration of existing data.

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### **Test Case 1: Basic Isolation**
```
1. Upload sales.db
2. Ask: "List all tables"
3. Switch to customers.db
4. Ask: "Show me data"
5. Switch back to sales.db
6. Ask: "What did I just ask?"
Expected: AI should NOT remember the customers.db conversation
```

### **Test Case 2: Multiple Databases**
```
1. Upload db1.db, db2.db, db3.db
2. Switch between them multiple times
3. Each should have independent conversation history
Expected: No cross-contamination
```

### **Test Case 3: Same Database, Multiple Sessions**
```
1. Upload sales.db
2. Have conversation A
3. Switch to another DB and back
4. Have conversation B
Expected: Conversation A is NOT visible in conversation B
```

## 📝 **Future Enhancements**

If you want to preserve chat history across database switches:

### **Option 1: Add database_id Column (Recommended)**
- Requires database migration
- Preserves all history
- More complex implementation

### **Option 2: Session Naming with Database ID**
```python
# Use consistent session ID format:
session_id = f"db_{database_id}"  # No UUID

# This would allow returning to the same conversation
# But risk mixing contexts if user reopens same DB later
```

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
```python
# Store database_id in session
# Load last N messages for this database_id regardless of session
# Best of both worlds but more complex queries
```

## 🔍 **Implementation Details**

### **Session Lifecycle:**

```
1. User Sign In
   └─> session["username"] = "john"
   └─> session["session_id"] = "random_uuid"

2. User Uploads Database
   └─> Database stored with unique ID

3. User Switches Database
   └─> session["session_id"] = f"{db_id}_{uuid}"
   └─> session["active_database_id"] = db_id
   └─> MCP client reconnects
   └─> New agents created with empty history

4. Chat Messages Saved
   └─> INSERT with current session_id
   └─> Tied to specific database

5. History Loaded
   └─> SELECT WHERE session_id = current
   └─> Only messages for active database context
```

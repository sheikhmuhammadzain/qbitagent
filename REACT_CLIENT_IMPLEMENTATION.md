## 🔧 Technical Details

### API Integration
All API calls go through `/api/*` endpoints:
- `POST /api/upload` - File upload
- `GET /api/databases` - List databases
- `POST /api/switch-database` - Switch database
- `GET /api/database/{id}/info` - Get database info
- `DELETE /api/database/{id}` - Delete database

### State Management
- Database switching updates:
  - ✅ `connected` state
  - ✅ `tools` array
  - ✅ `currentModel` (optional)
  - ✅ Clears messages

### TypeScript Types
All API responses are fully typed:
```typescript
UploadResponse
Database
DatabasesResponse
DatabaseInfoResponse
SwitchDatabaseResponse
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Tools Count Shows Zero
**Solution:** You need to:
1. Upload a file first
2. Select the database from the dropdown
3. The tools will auto-populate when you switch

### Upload Fails
**Check:**
- File is CSV or Excel format
- File size is under 100MB
- Backend server is running on port 8000

### Database Not Showing
**Try:**
- Click the refresh button (🔄)
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify file uploaded successfully (check toast notification)

### Can't Query Data
**Ensure:**
- Database is selected (dropdown shows database name)
- Status badge shows "Connected"
- Tools count is greater than 0
- Check chat input is enabled

## 📝 Example Workflow

```
1. User: Upload "sales_2024.csv" via drag-and-drop
   ↓
2. System: Shows progress → Success toast "Database created with 10 rows"
   ↓
3. User: Select "sales_2024.db" from database dropdown
   ↓
4. System: Auto-connects → Fetches tools → Status shows "Tools: 8"
   ↓
5. User: Types "What's the total revenue?"
   ↓
6. AI: Uses execute_query tool → Returns answer with streaming
   ↓
7. User: Views real-time response with tool calls displayed
```
